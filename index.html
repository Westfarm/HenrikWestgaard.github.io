                    <p>I'm 31 years old from Drammen, and I recently finished my degree for electrical engineering at
                        Oslomet. I moved to Oslo in 2018 after spending a year abroad in Australia. In Australia I lived
                        throughout the south-east
                        from Melbourne to Sydney, mainly staying in Canberra for work. Here I strengthened an already
                        native level fluency and learned to apply myself in a new environment entirely on my own.<span
                            id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                            <br> <br>

                            I spent a lot of time trying to decide on what I wanted to do in life. This led me to pursue
                            a broad field of interest. From graphical design, literature, philosophy and psychology
                            to electronics, computers and engineering. <br> <br>

                            I have from an early age been curious of how things work, from the physical to the
                            metaphysical, and this curiosity eventually carried over into my studies. <br>
                            Having struggled to find motivation and interest in school during my final years at VGS, i
                            dropped out to commit to skiing and gymnastics, but suffering an injury that required
                            surgery and rehabilitation made me rethink. Knowing I
                            eventually would want to go to university meant I had to finish my VGS education, so that's
                            what I did. Over the next few years I took all the required
                            subjects for social science "vitnemål" while working part time. <br> <br>

                            Most of my adult life I have in some capacity been helping my father run his physiotherapi
                            clinic. He suffers from Ushers Syndrome, which is a neurodegenerative condition that affects
                            his sight and hearing. His condition means he's slowly losing both sight and hearing
                            rendering him blind and partially deaf over time. Despite his condition he is the sole
                            proprietor of Åssiden Fysioterapi. To help ease the difficulties of his condition I have
                            taken on the
                            position of assistant. This means I do most of the paperwork and finances, as well as
                            general manegement, patient journals and booking.<br><br>


                            In 2015 I decided I wanted to do something related to science, and started working on the
                            required subjects of maths and physics to apply for higher education in that field.
                            I finished all my exams for the required science subjects by 2016, where I got the
                            opertunity to move to Australia for a year to experience living abroad. <br>
                            This year let me travel and meet new people. Despite not having any studies or job lined up
                            before departure I managed to find work and a network of friends within a short amount of
                            time. As I was on a working holiday visa I was limited to a maximum of 6 months employment
                            from
                            any single employer. This gave me the opertunity to try different types of work in entirely
                            different areas, helping me build a broader experience and understanding of culture.
                            <br><br>


                            Upon my return to Norway I had decided I wanted to persue an electrical engineering degree.
                            So I worked in Drammen, at PostNord until I had saved up enough to move to Oslo.
                            In Oslo I first took a precourse to engineering, working through the basics of university
                            maths and science, as well as more elaborate understanding of how engineers work and
                            operate. Upon completing the precourse I applied for and was accepted to electrical
                            engineering at
                            Oslomet. <br><br>


                            At Oslomet I made an effort to partake in all optional offers for social and academic
                            endevours, creating a large network of friends and getting on good terms with professors and
                            faculty right from the start. Within the first year of study I had already made lasting
                            relationships and went traveling abroad with fellow studnets and friends.
                            Having been used to spending large amounts of time at campus sosialising and working with
                            other people the Covid pandemic made this impossible. I therefore joined the creation of the
                            student organisation "The Resistance". Here I took on
                            the role as event organiser and was a member of the board. The idea of this organisation was
                            to unite the students for engineering at Oslomet and give
                            them a forum for communication and support despite the quarantine that was implemented.
                            We hosted social events, connected students across subjects and year to help each other and
                            to build networks. We contacted businesses like Siemens, Vingmed and ABB and hosted
                            presentations where people from the industry could
                            present their companies and get in contact with students. <br><br>

                            Electrical engineers at Oslomet have to choose between medical or industrial automation.
                            Wanting to work with automation, controllers, systems and programming, I chose industrial
                            automation where I took robotics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics
                            4 as my optional subjects for my final year along with my bachelor thesis. <br><br>

                            For my thesis I worked with three other students, and we contacted ABB where we were
                            selected amongst a large number of applicants to work on their project as our thesis.
                            The project was the continuation of a previous thesis that had been done by students at
                            Oslomet the previous year. We were tasked with creating an autonomous system capable of
                            unmanned inspection of remote installations, and given free reign on how we wanted to change
                            or implement on the system.
                            The previous project had laid the foundation with a camera mounted system that moved
                            linearly along a rail, capable of doing routine inspections at timed intervals.
                            Initially wanting to do a camera drone system, we resigned to continue prototyping on the
                            rail system, as government regulations on professional drone systems using
                            artificial intelligence and image recognition needed to be supervised and permits +
                            background checks on everyone involved in the project would need to be done.
                            These permits could take up to 6 months to get, meaning our deadline for thesis would be
                            over before we could even begin the project. <br>
                            If you want to read more about the thesis I'll provide a link further down on the website. <br><br>

                            In my free time I enjoy working on DIY projects, anything invovling home automation, fixing
                            electronics or designing. I do my own 3D printing and 3D modeling, PCB design,
                            circuits and soldering. The design aspect carries over into an interest in art and painting,
                            where I sketch, draw and paint both analog and digital, both recreation and for work.
                            I have broad experience in drawing up schematics and operate seamlessly between digital and
                            analog which means I'm good at realising projects. I am also a big fan of literature,
                            cinema, photography and gaming. To stay active I play
                            golf, disc golf, tennis, mountain bike in the summer and ski in the winter.
                            I enjoy traveling and frequently visit Spain where I have extended family. This has prompted
                            me to learn how to speak spanish fluently, and I'm currently at a B1 level.

            Having been a late student I have both the benefit of maturity while still having a fresh outlook on new problems that newly educated people tend to have. <br>
            This means I provide a new set of eyes on problems that may be difficult to solve with old methods, while still having more life experience to avoid mistakes of someone younger. <br>
            I am good at listening and taking other peoples opinions and perspectives into account when working on problems, and I'm often happy to take on a more central role in groups when working as a team.
            I think I'm a versitile person who regardless of position can provide benefit for a company that would hire me. <br><br>
